    <h2 class="large-heading">About Me</h2>

    <p>
      My passion is machines. Machines have a lot in common with us: they can breathe, sense their surroundings, and even manipulate their environment. Fortunately they don't come with the unpleasant bodily fluids that we come with. Learning, playing, and designing machines is an awesome experience so it should make sense why I ended up studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT.
    </p>

    <p>
      What I enjoy about machines is the technology that makes them tick. At MIT I embraced this world of technology possibly to an unhealthy level. I spent an absurd amount of time, at least according to my wife, working on projects some of which are briefly listed on this website. I enjoy working on projects because I like exploring different technologies and how they come together.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I was younger, my father always wanted me to participate in sports. During high school, I had ran track, ran cross-country, and wrestled. I am glad he pushed me to do this because it gave me the discipline to do the things I enjoy. The design process for a technology is very much like training for a sport. In sports you spend a lot of time training, trying to achieve your goal, and then failing. But you don't give up, you figure out what you did wrong, and you try again. And you continue this process until finally, success happens.
    </p>

    <p>
      On a more personal note, things I like to do include eating, sleeping, board games, working on projects, and spending time with my wife. My favorite movie is Babe, favorite book series is Hank the Cowdog, and favorite food is sushi. Some goals I have in the future are living on a farm and getting a pilot's license.
