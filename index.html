  <section class="about-me section section-yin">
    <h2 class="large-heading">About Me</h2>

    <p>My passion is machines. Machines have a lot in common with us: they can breathe, sense their surroundings, and even manipulate their environment. Fortunately they don’t come with the unpleasant bodily fluids that we come with. Learning, playing, and designing machines is an awesome experience so it should make sense why I ended up studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT.</p>

    <p>At MIT I embraced the world of machines even more and possibly to an unhealthy level. I spent an absurd amount of time, at least according to my wife, working on projects some of which are briefly listed on this website.</p>

    <p>Mechanical projects became my life and I ravenously learned all I could in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering. Unfortunately now that I am graduated project funds are harder to find, so hopefully I can work on helping someone else’s project team (Hint hint, hire me!). Help a project addict out by letting me obsessively immerse myself in doing something great while putting food on my table so my wife complains less about my work hours and project budgets.</p>
