<p>My partner Alan Casallas and I built an analog control system that controlled the speed of a brushless DC motor on an electric bicycle and harnessed the energy during the braking process. To drive the BLDC motor on the bicycle, we built a closed-loop feedback controlled circuit. This consisted of a three phase inverter circuit, an amplifier circuit, and
	a commutation circuit to generate the waveforms needed to commutate and spin the motor. A feedback circuit was constructed to drive the motor at a requested angular velocity. We designed analog closed loop controlled buck converter to increase the efficiency of our motor controller. We also implemented a regenerative braking circuit, which could potentially recharge the battery from power delivered by the motor as the bicycle wheels are braking. The regenerative braking circuit consisted of a boost converter that was self powered from its own output. The challenge was in combining the three-phase currents leaving the motor as it was braking
to safely recharge the battery in a power efficient manner.</p>
