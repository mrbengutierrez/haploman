			I worked on the pulmonary screener project as an undergraduate researcher in the Mobile Technologies Lab during the summer of my junior year at MIT. The goal of the project was to develop a way to screen patients for pulmonary issues. I used the google voice kit as the hardware for the device. The device would ask a patient a series of questions, and would collect the answers to those questions. The raw answers would be sent to an email, and a parsed version of the answers would be sent to a server.
