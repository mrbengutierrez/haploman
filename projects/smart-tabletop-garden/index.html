			My wife wanted a growth chamber, so we decided to try to make one. We made a wooden base with an adjustable top to accommodate different plants and light distance. We used a combination of white, blue, and red LED lights on the top portion to provide the most energy efficient source of light to the plants (as plants primarily use red and blue light). These were controlled separately so that the relative light levels could be adjusted to stimulate different stages of growth (for example red light stimulates flowering/fruiting) and the overall intensity of light could be changed. We used an arduino to control the chamber and set the different light levels. We also used a moisture sensor to read out the moisture levels of the soil to avoid over or under watering. We showcased this project at MIT's ProjXpo.
