<h2 class="center">Brief Description</h2>
<hr class="divider">
<div id=extra-space></div>

<p>Elevate, is a mechanical seat-lift add-on for manual wheelchairs. It is an easy to use, purely mechanical system. It involves no motors, requires no batteries, and changes height quickly up to 8 inches with ease. Elevate is made with high performance, lightweight materials: titanium and carbon fiber. This allows the device to remain under 5 pounds, comparable to the weight of a textbook. At the heart of Elevate is a gas spring--- which is tuned to support 30-50% of the user’s weight. To keep Elevate compact, the gas spring is placed behind the backrest, keeping it above the wheel axle and preventing it from catching on rough terrain. Elevate’s armrests are clamped to the wheelchair frame, providing a surface for the user to push off of as they squeeze the activation lever. When not in use the armrests can rotate up and out of the way. Finally, a rigid seat and backrest provide surfaces for the user to attach their cushion of choice.</p>
