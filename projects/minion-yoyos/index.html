			Take a look at the army of minions! In this project, I worked in a team of four to produce 50 yoyos. Manufacturing processes that were used included injection molding, CNC milling, thermoforming, laser cutting, punching, turning, and punching. We made 24 molds for injection molding in all and learned a lot about the perils of curved parting surfaces. Throughout the project we also learned how to machine our molds much faster by significantly by optimizing feed rate, spindle speed, material removal rate, cutting force, and surface finish.

			This project could not have been done without the help of my partners: Lily Mueller, Jonathan Sampson, and Marwa AlAlawi. I would also like to thank the shop staff Joe, Wade, and Dan.
