<p>Whenever you go to doctor’s office, there is something that a doctor always has on him: a
stethoscope. This device is ancient, yet is still incredibly useful and not outdated. However, like
many other products there is room for innovation. In recent history, purely mechanical devices
have been made consistently more reliable by adding electronics to improve their performance.
One solution is a mobile phone stethoscope. What makes this device innovative is the choice of using a piezoelectric
disk instead of a microphone to capture the heart and lung sounds. The way it works is that
sound from a patient’s chest travels to a piezoelectric disk at the diaphragm end of the
stethoscope. The sound vibrates the piezoelectric disk, and this vibration is converted into an
electrical signal. The signal is then processed and amplified by a mobile phone so a practitioner
can listen to it.

<p>
The advantages of this electronic stethoscope are twofold. First, a practitioner can in theory
listen to more amplified heart and lung sounds. In addition, a practitioner can also have the
sound recordings saved. This allows other practitioners analyzing a patient to be able actually
hear the heart and lung sounds that were recorded on the patient by a different practitioner.
